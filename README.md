## What is machine learning ?

It is a field of data science that basically is an amagamation of data and algorithm that we give to the machine to learn. In simple terms we have a lot of data we can use this large amounts of data and predict patterns using 
statistics and then we design an algorithm that predicts for future use based on the already available data .Then we make the machine or computers to use this algorithm and data to for predictions.
In 1959 , Arthur Samuel who worked in IBM invented the phrase 'Machine Learning'.
